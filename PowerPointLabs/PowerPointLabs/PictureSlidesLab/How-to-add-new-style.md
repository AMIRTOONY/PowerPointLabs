## How to add new style

0. Add any new properties to [Model/StyleOption.cs](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/PictureSlidesLab/Model/StyleOption.cs) by creating a partial class of StyleOption under folder `StyleOption.Partial`. For example, the new style may contain a shape, so this shape's color and transparency can be added to style option in order to control its properties.
1. Add the design effect (a basic design element) to [Service/EffectsDesigner.cs](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/PictureSlidesLab/Service/EffectsDesigner.cs) by creating a partial class of EffectsDesigner under folder `EffectsDesigner.Partial`. An effect is like a rectangle shape, a triangle shape, text format, textbox property etc. If it already has the effect you want, ignore this step.
2. Add a new style worker for [Service/StylesDesigner.cs](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/PictureSlidesLab/Service/StylesDesigner.cs) by creating a subclass of [IStyleWorker](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/PictureSlidesLab/Service/StylesWorker/Interface/IStyleWorker.cs), and register it to [StyleWorkerFactory](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/PictureSlidesLab/Service/StylesWorker/StyleWorkerFactory.cs). Tell it how to create your style by the given style option and effects.
3. Add a new style options for [ModelFactory/StyleOptionsFactory.cs](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/PictureSlidesLab/ModelFactory/StyleOptionsFactory.cs) by creating a subclass of [BaseStyleOptions](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/PictureSlidesLab/ModelFactory/Options/BaseStyleOptions.cs), and register it to StyleOptionsFactory. Generate your style's default style option (for the preview stage) and 8 default style options (for the variation stage).
4. Add a new style variants for [ModelFactory/StyleVariantsFactory.cs](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/PictureSlidesLab/ModelFactory/StyleVariantsFactory.cs) by creating a subclass of [BaseStyleVariants](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/PictureSlidesLab/ModelFactory/Variants/BaseStyleVariants.cs) and creating a subclass of [IVariantWorker](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/PictureSlidesLab/ModelFactory/VariantWorker/Interface/IVariantWorker.cs). Generate your style's variants (for the variation stage).
5. Add any new string constants to TextCollection.cs, e.g. new style name, and new variant (category) name.
6. Example for Banner Style: [StyleOption.Banner](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/PictureSlidesLab/Model/StyleOption.Partial/StyleOption.BannerStyle.cs), [BannerStyleWorker](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/PictureSlidesLab/Service/StylesWorker/BannerStyleWorker.cs), [BannerStyleOptions](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/PictureSlidesLab/ModelFactory/Options/BannerStyleOptions.cs), [BannerVariantWorker](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/PictureSlidesLab/ModelFactory/VariantWorker/BannerVariantWorker.cs), [BannerStyleVariants](https://github.com/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/blob/master/PowerPointLabs/PowerPointLabs/PictureSlidesLab/ModelFactory/Variants/BannerStyleVariants.cs). 

### Notes
0. Continuity: the new style in the preview stage should match one variation in its beginning variation stage. E.g. the new style has a default effect with color `#FFFFFF` and transparency `35` in the preview stage, so when flyout opens (beginning variation stage) it should have one variation that matches this color and transparency. This can be achieved by adjusting StyleOptionsFactory.cs and StyleVariantsFactory.cs.
1. Step-by-step Customization: all variations in the beginning variation stage should match one variant in each variant category. E.g. a variation with font color `#FFFFFF`, font size `+0`, font `Calibri`, and text position `left` will match variant `#FFFFFF` in the font color category, variant `+0` in the font size category, variant `calibri` in the font category, and variant `left` in the text position category.
2. This behaviour is protected by unit test.
